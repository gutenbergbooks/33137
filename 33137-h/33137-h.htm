<h2><b>Article XVI.</b>&mdash;DESCRIPTIONS OF THREE NEW BIRDS FROM<br />
THE BELGIAN CONGO.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By James P. Chapin.</span></h3>

<p>The whole of the large collection of birds secured by the Congo Expedition
of the American Museum of Natural History during the years 1909
to 1915, under the leadership of Mr. Herbert Lang, has now arrived safely
at the Museum. It is composed of material gathered all across the Belgian
Congo, from Boma on the west to Aba in the northeastern corner, but the
greater part from the more remote territory between Stanley Falls and the
Enclave of Lado, including the dense equatorial forests of the Ituri, Nepoko,
and Bomokandi, and the high-grass and bush country of the Uele District
to the north and northeast.</p>

<p>Of the relatively small number of zoölogical expeditions that have passed
through and collected in these regions, none has ever before been able to
make such a prolonged stay, and the varied zoölogical results of this Expedition
are surely of the highest scientific interest. The ornithological collection
contains in the neighborhood of six thousand skins, and represents
some 600 different species, a number of them of course new to science.
These it is our purpose to describe as promptly as possible in this Bulletin,
before taking up the greater work of a general report on all the forms collected,
with more extended notes on their distribution, habits, food, and
nests.</p>

<p>Descriptions of the first three new forms follow:</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h2><b>Chætura melanopygia</b> sp. nov.</h2>

<blockquote><p>Related to <i>C. stictilæma</i>, but much larger, with feathers of upper breast more
heavily margined with blackish, and without any trace of a light rump-band.</p>

<p>Description of type, collector's No. 4986 Congo Exp. A. M. N. H., &#9794; ad.
Avakubi, Ituri District, Belgian Congo, Aug. 15, 1913.</p>

<p>Upper parts brownish-black (chætura-black, Ridgw.) becoming black on wings
and tail, with faint violet and green reflections (green on freshly molted feathers).
Ear coverts drab, bordered with fuscous-black; feathers of throat pale smoke-gray,
margined with fuscous, those of upper breast similar, but heavily bordered with
fuscous-black, consequently with a very pronounced "scaly" appearance; lower
breast growing darker, so that the dark borders are less conspicuous, and the feathering
of the belly completely fuscous-black with slight oily gloss. Under wing coverts
mouse-gray with darker edges, flanks and under tail-coverts black with slight greenish
gloss. Tail slightly rounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
    Iris dark brown, bill black, feet bluish, shading to dusky brown on tips of toes
and claws. Sexual organs enlarged.</p>

<p>Length (skin) 145 mm.; wing 164; tail 49.5; bill (exposed culmen), 7.5; metatarsus
13.</p></blockquote>

<p>Only one specimen secured, out of two or three of these swifts that were
flying about over the Ituri River, in company with several examples of
<i>Chætura cassini</i>. In spite of our long stay in this region, the species was not
again positively recognized; but <i>Chætura cassini</i>, <i>C. stictilæma</i> and <i>C.
sabinei</i> were all of common occurrence there.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h2><b>Apaloderma minus</b> sp. nov.</h2>

<p>Resembling <i>Apaloderma narina</i>, but decidedly smaller, of different coloration,
and with bill less swollen. The serration of the maxilla is less pronounced.</p>

<p>The adult male of <i>A. minus</i> is distinguished by the bluer hue of the forehead,
throat, and upper breast, which show in certain lights deep violet
reflections, and by the more scarlet, less crimson color of the remaining
underparts. In life the naked areas on the cheeks are bright yellow, whereas
in <i>A. narina</i> they are light green.</p>

<p>The adult female differs in the more tawny or ochraceous coloration of
the breast, which is grayish in this sex of <i>A. narina</i>, although sometimes
washed with light brown on the upper breast. A greenish gloss on the
upper breast is more common in females of <i>A. narina</i>.</p>

<p>In juvenal plumage both species are entirely buff below, the feathers
more or less tipped with dusky.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Type: collector's No. 4983. Congo Exp. A. M. N. H. &#9794; ad. Avakubi
Ituri District, Belgian Congo, August 13, 1913.</p>

<p><i>Description of Adult Male</i> (type).&mdash;Throat, upper breast, lores and forehead
glossy wall-green, in certain lights with violet reflections; upper tail-coverts much
the same, but nape and back brilliant peacock-green. Lower breast, sides, belly,
and under tail-coverts bright scarlet-red; feathering of legs dusky, with faint green
gloss and slightly bordered with whitish. Primaries fuscous-black, the outer ones
margined with white and the inner ones white at the base. Alula and primary-coverts
blackish; lesser wing-coverts blackish, broadly margined with green; middle
coverts with less green and vermiculated with white. Greater coverts and secondaries
blackish vermiculated with white, the former narrowly edged with green, the
secondaries only very faintly. Three middle pairs of rectrices blackish, slightly
glossed with violet-blue and margined with green; outer three pairs white, with
bases black faintly glossed with blue, this blackish color extending out furthest on
inner webs, and finally breaking up into small dusky spots.</p>

<p>Iris red-brown; distal portion of bill light greenish gray, base of bill and two
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
naked patches beneath eye light cadmium-yellow, naked skin above eye lemon-yellow;
bare skin of foreneck (covered in life by plumage) light blue; feet pale pink.</p>

<p>Length (skin) 254 mm.; length of bill (culmen from base) 18 mm.; height of
bill at nostril 9.5 mm.; greatest width of maxilla, near gape, 16 mm.; wing (measured
with dividers) 113 mm.; tail 146 mm.</p>

<p>In some of the other male specimens the green borders on the secondaries are
lacking, and the exact intensity of the white vermiculation is of course variable.
The measurements of a series of 11 adult males are: bill, 17-18.5 mm.; wing, 108-115.5;
tail, 136.5-151. This is smaller than any <i>Apaloderma</i> heretofore described.</p>

<p><i>Adult Female.</i> Crown, back, and rump brilliant peacock-green, upper tail-coverts
viridian. Lores, forehead, and ear-coverts more brownish; throat and
upper breast snuff-brown, sometimes with glossy green at sides of neck or a few
narrow green borders on the chest. Lower breast cinnamon, sometimes finely barred
with dusky; belly somewhat lighter and rosier than that of male; feathering of legs
dusky. Tail similar to that of male; but the vermiculation on the wing-coverts
and secondaries is very much finer, and light ochraceous-buff, not white.</p>

<p>Iris red-brown; naked cheek-patches lemon-yellow, base of bill slightly deeper
yellow; culmen dusky, bill light green below; feet flesh-color, claws gray.</p>

<p>Measurements of three adult females: bill (culmen from base), 17-17.5 mm.;
wing 104.5-113 mm.; tail, 140-149 mm.</p>

<p>An <i>immature male</i> has the green of the upper breast broken by irregular bars of
cinnamon. The lower breast is cinnamon mixed with rose, and barred at the sides
with green, and shades to light scarlet-red on belly and under <a name="tail" id="tail"></a>tail-coverts. The
greater wing-coverts and three inner secondaries bear each a large spot of light
ochraceous buff, extending across the whole width of the innermost secondary, and
most of the secondaries are vermiculated or speckled on their outer webs with buff.
Just behind the eye there is a small spot of white, and the lower edge of the ear-coverts
is marked by a buff line.</p>

<p>Iris dark brown; maxilla dusky, but its base greenish-yellow like the naked cheek-patches,
mandible light yellowish-green, with light-gray tip; feet pinkish. Bill,
18.5 mm.; wing, 108; tail, 139.</p>

<p>A <i>nestling</i> (&#9794;), with tail only 25 mm. long, is of a yellower green above (calliste
green); lores, forehead and entire underparts cinnamon-buff, the downy feathers
slightly tipped with dusky except on abdomen. The wing-coverts and inner secondaries
bear large spots of buff. Iris brownish-gray; bill very light bluish-gray, its
base and corners of mouth greenish-yellow; feet pale flesh-color, claws gray.</p>

<p>The spots on the inner secondaries, in the first plumage, appear to be much larger
in the case of <i>A. minus</i> than with <i>A. narina</i>, for an immature female specimen of
the latter shows only rounded spots on the outer webs not exceeding 5.5 mm. in diameter,
while the additional buffy speckling is practically absent.</p>
</div>

<p>This trogon was found by us in the Ituri forest, from the Nepoko River
south to Avakubi and westward to Banalia, but its range is certainly wider
than this. It is a species perfectly distinct from <i>Apaloderma narina</i>, but
both occur in the same forests, though the latter was also to be heard at
times in areas of tall second-growth, whereas <i>A. minus</i> seemed never to leave
the primitive uncut forest, and was extremely shy and difficult to observe.
These two trogons may easily be recognized by their voices, the common
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
note of <i>A. narina</i> being a double, dove-like "cu-coo," which is repeated
slowly for several seconds, starting faintly but increasing in strength, and
accompanied by a slight wagging of the tail. That of <i>A. minus</i> is a series
of longer, more mournful sounds that might be represented by the word
"kwaw." These calls are given by the males.</p>

<p>As compared with the measurements given in Prof. Reichenow's "Vögel
Afrikas" and the British Museum Catalogue, our specimens of <i>Apaloderma
narina</i> from the Ituri District seem rather small, and may belong to the
race <i>æquatoriale</i> of Dr. Sharpe.</p>

<p>A series of 12 adult males measures: bill (culmen from base) 18.5-21
mm.; wing 117.5-128; tail 146.5-166. The green borders of the secondaries
are never very well marked, and sometimes virtually absent.</p>

<p>Seven females from the same region measure: Bill, 18.5-21; Wing 117.5-129;
Tail, 149-169.</p>

<p>One male collected in the Uele District, in a small forest tract between
Faradje and Aba, is strikingly larger; wing, 134; tail 194. This example
is probably referable to <i>A. n. narina</i>.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h2><b>Ceriocleptes</b> gen. nov. (Indicatoridæ).</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Resembling <i>Indicator</i> in its bill and general form, save for the tail, which is composed
of 12 quills, the two middle pairs of nearly equal length, somewhat pointed and
curved strongly outwards, the next pair considerably shorter, but also pointed and
slightly curved; while the fourth, fifth and sixth are straight, greatly narrowed, and
stiffened, becoming successively shorter, so that the outermost pair is not half so
long as the median. The tail-coverts are unusually long, those below as long as the
longest rectrices, and projecting in the fork of the tail.</p>
</div>

<p class="caption">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fig. 1. Tail of <i>Ceriocleptes xenurus</i>,<br />
from below. Nat. size.</p>
</div>

<p>Feathers of forehead, crown, back, and rump blackish-brown, bordered or washed
with yellowish-citrine, those of nape and upper back whitish at the base. Sides of
head lighter, shading gradually to olive-buff on throat, breast, and sides; middle
of abdomen still lighter, ivory-yellow. Upper wing-coverts and secondaries fuscous-black
(freshly molted feathers blacker) narrowly edged with olive-ocher. Primaries
similar, but yellowish border almost entirely lacking; both primaries and secondaries
fading to pale olive-buff on their inner edges. Under wing-coverts colored like
the breast, but with faint dusky shaft-streaks. Feathering of flanks ivory-yellow,
with strong blackish median lines. Two middle pairs of rectrices dull blackish, 3rd
pair whitish, with a small blackish spot on the outer edge close to the tip, and a larger
concealed black spot on the inner web towards the base; the 3 remaining pairs of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
rectrices white. The long median pair of under tail-coverts blackish, the next pair
similar, but margined with whitish, the remainder ivory-yellow with faint shaft-streaks
of dark brown. Upper tail-coverts
fuscous-black, bordered with amber-yellow.
    <a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The bill, nostril, and feet resemble those
of <i>Indicator indicator</i>, but the bill is somewhat
stouter, while the wings and tail are
shorter. The 9th (outer) primary is intermediate
in length between the 6th and 5th;
the 7th and 8th are longest.</p>

<p>Iris bright brown, naked edges of eyelids
grayish-brown; bill dusky-brown; feet dull
grayish-green.</p>

<p>Length (skin), 160 mm.; wing, 93.5; tail
56; bill (culmen from base), 13.5; metatarsus,
14.</p>
</div>

<p>This unique specimen was shot by the
describer from a tall tree in the forest,
where it was accompanied by one other
of its kind. The sexual organs were somewhat
enlarged; the stomach filled with beeswax, mixed with small pieces of
insects. Apparently this species is not in the habit of leading men to
beehives.</p>

<h2>BULLETIN.</h2>

<p>The matter in the 'Bulletin' consists of about 24 to 36 articles per volume, which
relate about equally to Geology, Palæontology, Mammalogy, Ornithology, Entomology,
and (in former volumes) Anthropology, except Vol. XI, which is restricted to a 'Catalogue
of the Types and Figured Specimens in the Palæontological Collection of the Geological
Department,' and Vols. XV, XVII, and XVIII, which relate wholly to Anthropology. Volume
XXIII and the later volumes contain no anthropological matter, which is now issued
separately as 'Anthropological Papers.'</p>
